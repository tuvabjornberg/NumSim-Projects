# Numeriska metoder och simulering 

## Project 1: Rocket-steering
Guide an unmanned rocket towards a given target with a limited amount of fuel available through a steering function. 

## Project 2: Epedemic modeling
Different models are presented that can be used to model the course of an epidemic. Both deterministic and stochastic simulations to investigate the impact of chance on the results.
